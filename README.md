# tictactoe
Your goal for this project is to write a game engine for tic tac toe.

You are given the primary engine and the interface to implement.
Implement the interface such that it will determine if a player
has won the game, if the game has concluded in a tie, and what player
won the game.

Try to do all work SOLO and look through the given code for answers to
some of your questions about implementation. If you have any questions,
reach out to me. Some questions i will not answer.

Here is the interface to implement.

```
type Engine interface {
    GameState([3][3]Piece, []Player) State
}
```


At the end of the week, we will get together and run our engines, test our
engines, and compare our engines.
